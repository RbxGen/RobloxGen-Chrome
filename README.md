# Usage
This requires a [RobloxGen v2](https://github.com/RbxGen/RobloxGen) server

To import this into Chrome:
1. Extract the release
2. Visit chrome://extensions
3. Toggle the "Developer mode" slider
5. Drag the extracted folder into Chrome

If your RobloxGen server isn't hosted on your computer (localhost) then you can go into the extension options and change the host to something else (for example: http://123.456.789 or http://mycoolwebsite.com)

Now updated to use the RobloxGen v2 API
